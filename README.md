# refactored-disco
Etch-A-Sketch Project created as part of Odin Project's Web Development curriculum.

A dynamic X by X grid was created using CSS Grids. User can reset the size of the grid using the buttons available.
On mouse hover over a grid cell, the background color will change. Like a line moving through a paper, grid background colors will change when mouse hovers over them. The background color change will remain even after mouse moves over to a next grid cell.

An Erase button is present to erase the contents of the grids.

Following color options are available which can be triggered through the appropriate buttons.
1. Rainbow
2. Grayscale
3. Random
4. Yellow (Default color).
